This repo contains an assignment I had to do during my studies, 
It aims to help an autonomous drive engine to identify what is in front of him,
it concentrate more than 80 classes and images are generated with the boundaries of the object + the confidence the algorithm has into the classification. 

It uses the YOLO procedure to learn classification.

To run the script you need to change the directories indicated in the jupyter notebook and you have to merge all images into one single repo called "image"
